# 🛡️ Aegis of Alderaan – The Ultimate Network Resilience System

In a hyper‑connected digital universe, the Aegis of Alderaan stands as a guardian of harmony.  
It is an intelligent, self‑sustaining system of autonomous agents that monitor, predict, and protect enterprise networks from rogue agents, anomalous traffic, and unforeseen spikes — ensuring resilience and adaptability.

## 🚀 Features
- Autonomous agents for continuous monitoring
- Anomaly detection and prediction of potential network issues
- Integration with real-time traffic analysis tools (e.g., Wireshark)
- Modern frontend dashboard to visualize insights and alerts
- Backend services (Node.js & Python) for data collection, analysis, and mitigation

## ⚙️ Prerequisites

Before starting, make sure you have these installed:

- ✅ [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (v14+ recommended)
- ✅ [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) (comes with Node.js)
- ✅ [Python 3](https://www.python.org/) (for data analysis / AI modules)
